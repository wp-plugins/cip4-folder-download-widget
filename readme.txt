A widget that list all files in a defined folder for download.

== Description ==

This widget lists all files form a specified directory for download. Further, 
there is a download counter which indicates the total number downloads per file.
In contrast to most other download manager, this widget comes without a database.
All information needed are stored in a hidden CSV file in the directory.

Another advantage, no manual upload of files is needed. Just put your fils via ssh
or ftp to the specified directory and everything is fine. 

Originally this plugin was developed for personal use, only. However, if you like it, feel free
